Todo list:
	Create a better GUI (currently it's all placeholders).

	Create sound player to lose dependency on windows media player

Impediments:

  When selecting a point for a "clip", the mouse click is retrieved as an integer.
    TODO: Retrieve mouse position on click as a double or float for higher precision.
    WHY: Mouse cursor seems to only snap to pixels by integer amounts.

        (Workaround implemented - limitation of c#)
